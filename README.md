# FacebookPlugin
It is a plugin to force u not to message the person you dont want to.
# About
Sometimes we are angry with someone on the facebook, like I was, and 
we dont want to talk with that person, but we keep pressing the link 
to that person from the chat list. This plugin solves that problem by
closing that chatbox if we open it.
# Issues
1. We have to click on the document for the first time to close the chatbox.
# Limitations
1. Name can be set from the source code for now.
2. It works for only one name.
3. Not sure if it will work for everyone as I have just tested it for my own
   account.
4. If facebook changes the CSS classes names, it will no longer work and someone 
   has to change the source code in order to make it work again.
# Disclaimer
I am not endorsing or provoking any person for not to talk with their 
beloved ones. This project is for fun and I made it when I was angry.
